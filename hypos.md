To investigate the research questions above, an experiment similar to Conaway & Kurtz (2016) will be conducted. The basic proceeding is: participants will receive instructions for the task at hand. 

There will be a total of 4 groups:
1. A control group A that will receive to experimental treatment; that is,no rule-related language in the instructions as well as the full set of training stimuli from the get-go.
2. A group B that will receive no rule-related language, but will only encounter a reduced set of stimuli, such that they only have to learn very simple rule (a type I solution in SHJ-terms) before encountering the full set (resulting in an incomplete XOR solution)
3. A group C that will receive rule-related language, but no 'simple rule first'.
4. A group D that will receive rule-related language in the instructions as well as a simple rule first.

With that, we can establish these hypotheses:
H1.1: There will be a main effect of the simple rule first condition on the overall accuracy during training (Mean_acc of Group B > Group A)
H1.2: There will be a main effect of the simple rule first condition on the number of extrapolated responses on the nine critcal items during the generalization phase (N_ext of Group B > Group A)
H2.1: There will be a main effect of rule related language on the overall accuracy during training (Mean_acc of Group C > Group A)
H2.2: There will be a main effect of rule related language on the number of extrapolated responses on the nine critcal items during the generalization phase (N_ext of Group C > Group A)

The relation betwen the effect of rule ordering and the effect of rule related language is unclear as of yet; whether the one is larger than the other, if they are additive or interacting in any way at all. An additive effect seems most likely as both experimental modulations aim to aid the subjects in categorization / rule learning in a different way. Therefore we propose the following hypotheses regarding the fit of our models:

H3: 


H3: There will be a difference in the effects of rule related language and rule ordering (Mod_AB != Mod_AC)
H4: Both effects in question will yield
