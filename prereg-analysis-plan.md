## Responses for untrained items in transfer phase

- bayesian logistic regression
- Hx.x ("")


## Analysis of transfer phase

### Hx.x: Accuracy Estimates

- bayesian logistic regression
- dependent var.: number of extrapolated responses
- fixed effects:
    - main effect of experimental condition (int_only < rrl ~= srf < srf&rrl)
- random effects:
    - by-subject intercepts, slopes for experimental condition
- comparison of (log) odds for extrapolation between conditions
